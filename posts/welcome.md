## hello.

Most of this blog will probably be an informal, rant-like format.  Over the years, I've been privileged enough to have written on [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/anormaljourney), which has gotten me pretty far.  I mostly cover the following:

- What the future of technology could look like.

- Web3 and blockchain.  More specifically, [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network) and [Substrate](https://substrate.io), as that is my current occupational (and personal) interest.

- Rust and WebAssembly.

- Sometimes I stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/baderyo_o)

At the time of this writing, I work as a technical educator at the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation), where I work on education surrounding blockchain engineering, design, and architecture.

I usually like to explore nuanced topics that relate to all of these things above, such as rebuilding the [internet using ants](https://hackernoon.com/reinventing-the-internet-welcome-to-the-antinet-bog001).

## FAQ

### How do you say your name?

I am not sure why you want to know, but Bader, Bay-der, Badder, Budder, or other pronunciation all work, as I really do not care. The list goes on, really any pronunciation works.  If you really want, pronounce it like Bed-e*rr*, but roll the _r_.

If I got you to try saying it while reading this, my goal is complete.

### What was this blob built with?

This blog was born out of my love for Rust.  It was made using Yew, which is a fantastic way for me to avoid writing JavaScript.  In short, Yew compiles to WebAssembly, a portable format that can be executed in almost any modern browser.

### Isn't blockchain/web3 a hype industry?

 Not really.  The technology is sound, and applications infinite, but the reality often disappointing.  It will surely improve with time, as it has the potential to fundamentally change how we define computation over the internet.

### What are you working on now?

Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/CrackTheCode016), it's the best place to stalk any projects.
